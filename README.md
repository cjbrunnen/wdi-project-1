## First project for WDI - Guacamole

### Guacamole - the Mexican-themed whack-a-mole game!

My abuela has asked me to make some guacamole for her as soon as possible so I'm enlisting your help.
In GUACAMOLE, the aim is to let the music take you away... oh, and to make as much guac as you can! 

#### [CLICK HERE to play GUACAMOLE now!!!]
(guacamole-cjbrunnen.herokuapp.com/ "¡Vamanos!")

### Rules of the game::::
Upon hitting the *START* button, you will have 30 seconds to whack that guac and rack up your scores. Your points will turn into pots of guacamole, so whack as many as you can! 
Be careful though! - there are good and bad characters in this game. 
Hit an *avocado* to win 1 point, a *sombrero* for two points and a **spinning taco** for 5 points! Avoid the *chillis* though, making it too hot looses you 2 points a piece!!! And my abuela doesn't like it too spicy. So keep it mild, child.

When the time is up, you will be shown your score. 
*Good luck!!! ¡¡¡Buena suerte!!!*

### The Build
I have used html, css and jQuery to build this game.
The music is curtosey of a post by Mihai Constantin Alexandru, of the 'Best Mariachi Music' and can be found here:
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klVe7_2UEQ8) - my thanks to Mihai for his post and all credit to the musicians featured. 
All game tokens are curtosey of google images and if any copyright infringements are present, I am happy to adapt and correct.

### How did I go about making my game
1. I first of all thought of the areas of coding that I am most comfortable with at this moment in time. 
2. I then thought through a few different ideas and settled on a whack-a-mole type set up where a user would click their way through to a win.
3. I wrote a very thorough pseudocode which took me through the game step by step.
4. I created a Trello board to break down my schedule into different steps, assigning each task a different level of priority.
5. Working through my Trello board and my pseudocode, I set out the functions for my game.
6. Once the jQuery structure was in place and working, I styled the page with CSS.

### Challenges
Being completely new to jQuery, and with only a week's training in html and css, I understandably found this task extremely hard. I have ended up including syntax and formulae that I had not seen before and I had to work on my styling to get it all just right.

### Acknowledgements
As well as the right honourable Mihai Constantin Alexandru, I would like to thank my GA instructors Alex Chin and Rane Gowan for their help and support throughout this first project. It is very true to say that I wouldn't have been able to complete the task without them. It is my goal from this day to be able to one day help them on the level they have helped me this last week.
